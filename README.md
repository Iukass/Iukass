# My familiar & proficient languages

## Python
I first began with python as my first language back in 2020. I had done a course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp/) which got me started into learning on from there. Currently I still use Python as one of my main programming languages. 

## C#
After learning Python, I wanted to get into game development with Unity & did another course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-csharp-masterclass/) for normal C# coding & did a [second course](https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse2/) for Unity Programming. Today I do not use unity anymore but when needed, I still use the C# language.

## C++
After a year or two, I wanted to learn C++, as I believed it would come in useful some day. I did a [online 1 to 1 class](https://www.schoolofit.com/cplusplus-courses/) where I learned the most there is to know about C++. I will soon be completing my __C++ Institue Exam (C++ Certified Associate Programmer)__. Today C++ is my main coding language.

## Front-end Web Development
Currently, I am still learning the gist of HTML & CSS as I do not do web development except when it comes to personal interest. I will be doing further courses from the [HTML](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HD13eq_Pmp8) & [CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRNinF7YQqQ) short-courses I have already done.

## What will be soon added?
In the future I will be learning Javascript & more mobile app based languages hopefully.
